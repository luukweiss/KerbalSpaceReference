# KerbalSpaceReference

Hello! This application is a project to capture nummeric values and mathematics about Kerbal Space Program. This project is aimed at players or enthusiasts that like
orbital mechanics or just a pretty application. The goals are to be accurate, meaningful (or additive) and pretty. This means:

###accurate
Or up to date, which means whenever stats change this needs to be updated (or fetched from external remote)

### meaninfull
Or additive, means it should add to the game. Yes a lot of statistics can be injected via game mods like mechjeb and even latest versions of KSP have generally good information and statistics.
The goals is not to replace those things, but rather have meaningful in-flight data or calculation manners so the base game experience can be improved. Think about where does the atmosphere starts
on eve? Or how much Delta V do I minimal need to reach and get captured in the Jool system? These things are easily found online, but this means tabbing out the base game and searching for it.

### pretty
The application should be pleasure to use. It should spark wonder into the engineers that we are. It should have important stuff yes, but why not coat it in something special, you know?
Because I'm not an UI expert or front-end guy don't expect much. We just do what we can and learn as we go.


~ Much love, Luuk
